Just a little companion script for phaser game developers. It generates a json file that maps out assets in a target directory to match the required data structure.
See https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.60.0/focus/Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin-pack

See https://github.com/mihneadb/node-directory-tree/tree/3.5.1 for how to define regex

Invocation:
```shell
npx  @paxperscientiam/generate-phaser3-filepack [assetdir | [assetdir] [comma-separated-list-of-extensions] ]


```

Notes:
- this script does NOT write anything to file; it's up to you to do so.
