Just a little companion script for phaser game developers. It generates a json file that maps out assets in a target directory to match the required data structure.
See https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.60.0/focus/Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin-pack

Example invocation:
```shell
node index.js assets/
```

Notes:
- this script does NOT write anything to file; it's up to you to do so.
